TortoiseGit is a free open-source client for the Git version control system. That is, TortoiseGit manages files over time. Files are
stored in a local repository. The repository is much like an ordinary file server, except that it remembers every change ever made
to your files and directories. This allows you to recover older versions of your files and examine the history of how and when your
data changed, and who changed it. This is why many people think of Git and version control systems in general as a sort of “time
machine”.
